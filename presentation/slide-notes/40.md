## ðŸŽ¬ (40) wrapup

- a few common themes
  - pushing the boundariews of whats possible for the web
  - working groups trying to catch up
  - vendors doing their own thing
  - trying to create simple declarative ways of doing complex spatial layouts and styles
  - relatively simple - compared to say, shaders in gaming or something
  - expansion into new areas
- all (mostly) backwards compatible!
