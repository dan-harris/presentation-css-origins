## ðŸŽ¬ (28) CSS Preprocessors

- browser vendors (mostly) implement majority of CSS standards
- start to see a 'rapid' explosion in use of HTML/CSS driven experiences
- web apps begin their clawing rise
- even with standards on the rise, many turn to CSS preprocessors, like SASS & LESS to fill the gaps
- SASS Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets)
- no runtime logic ðŸ˜¢
- much like javascript becomes a little later, start realisiing that CSS can be a compile target
- bootstrap!!
