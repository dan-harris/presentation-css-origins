## ðŸŽ¬ (12) Cascading-HTML-Stylesheet (CSS1) proposal

- HÃ¥kon Lie's proposal (pronounciation?)
- a little different from CSS, but beginning of the spec for how we write css today
- combined other proposals
- selectors and specificity
- CHSS supports shared influence between authors and users. Each party can indicate a requested influence as a percentage of the total influence
- The rule in the above example asks for 40% of the influence over H2 elements' font size. User style sheets are given priority when influence is assigned, and author style sheets come second. The proposal foresees that the user [..] may request total control of the presentation, but â€“ more likely â€“ hands most of the influence over to the [author].
- The syntax of CHSS also includes logical expressions involving environment variables to determine when/if a rule should be applied
