## ðŸŽ¬ (23) CSS3 is specced

- W3G is still hard at work - releasing CSS3 at a similar time as CSS2.1
- IE dominance and a plateau of mainstream web
- Even with continual shaming, many vendors ignore the standards and go it alone
- splits the spec into 'modules'
- allows the spec to move alot quicker
- no 'CSS4'
