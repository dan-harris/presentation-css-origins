## ðŸŽ¬ (19) A year later... CSS 2

- before the ink is dry on CSS1, W3C goes for CSS2
- browsers still havent really implemented CSS1 (to spec)
- bam, updated again
- CSS 2.1 is quickly ratified after CSS 2, fixes a bunch of issues and vendor specific styling
- more info here
- cool new features
  - all the good stuff!!
  - content - to be extensively abused in 10 years time
  - overflow
  - z-index
  - attribute selectors `E[foo="warning"]`
  - more complex selectors `*`, `>`, `+`
  - relative units
  - position
  - display table
